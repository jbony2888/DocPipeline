    "essay_text": "I always hear people talking about how important a mothers love is. But never hear people talking about the importance of the love of a father. People never seem to talk about how powerful and important the love of a father is. And my father means the world to me because he is hardworking, brave and loving. He is hardworking. One reason is whenever something is broken even if he is tired, or its his day off, he will try to to fix it And he has also worked the hardest jobs everyday of the week just to take care of his family he works so hard, for the best for his family. This shows how my father is hardworking because he took his day offs and helps around the house. Like fixing problems around the house, even if he has other things to do. My father is a really hard working parent. My father is a brave person. One way he shows that hes brave is that he sacrificed almost everything for are family, he has left his country to get here.And he isn't scared to take risks in his life. He would do anything for his family. Finally he is a very loving dad. Because he cares for me and his family he does everything to make us happy, he takes us to roadtrips he buys us stuff like food, he shows his love though the biggest and smallest things. My dad will always love his family because I know that he is a very kind and loving father. My father means the world to me because he is hardworking, brave and loving. So I ask you, have you ever stopped to think about what you're father means to you. I say this because I always hear people talking about how much the love of a mother means but never how important and powerful the love of a father is.",
