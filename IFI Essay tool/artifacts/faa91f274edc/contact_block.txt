My Father is the beast because he makes me enjoy my life for example. My
Father loves to watch Mexican episodes of El Chapo.Another thing is that
he loves to eat pozole !ymmy!. Me and my dad love to talk about life. My
father means the world to me because he's unconditional love, very funny
and supportive.
One reason that my father means the world to me is because he
gives me unconditional love. When I was playing soccer at home I
accidentally broke the mirror.My dad forgave me and talked to me about
the accident he said he was not going to snitch on me. When i was 10 year
old I got really bad grades I was a bit upset but my dad was there to
conference me and told me he was going to help me study. This are the
reasons my dad gives me unconditional love.
The second reason why my father means the world to me is because
his very
funny.One reason why my father is really funny is because when
I was 6 years old I was mad because my friend was being mean and
ignoring me but my father was there p cheer me up he is the best. He was
saying silly jokes HaHa I still remember that day.The second reason why my
father is really funny is because even thought i'm happy he still makes me
laugh. Because when i was going to turn 10 years old we were going to cut
the cake.But then he said something really funny I even remember when I
almost peed myself while laughing.The 3th reason why my father is really
funny is because when I'm mad or sad he still makes me happy.This are all
the reasons why my father is really funny.
