    "essay_text": "My Father is the beast because he makes me enjoy my life for example. My Father loves to watch Mexican episodes of El Chapo. Another thing is that he loves to eat pozole !ymmy!. Me and my dad love to talk about life. My father means the world to me because he's unconditional love, very funny and supportive. One reason that my father means the world to me is because he gives me unconditional love. When I was playing soccer at home I accidentally broke the mirror. My dad forgave me and talked to me about the accident he said he was not going to snitch on me. When i was 10 year old I got really bad grades I was a bit upset but my dad was there to conference me and told me he was going to help me study. This are the reasons my dad gives me unconditional love. The second reason why my father means the world to me is because his very funny. One reason why my father is really funny is because when I was 6 years old I was mad because my friend was being mean and ignoring me but my father was there p cheer me up he is the best. He was saying silly jokes HaHa I still remember that day. The second reason why my father is really funny is because even thought i'm happy he still makes me laugh. Because when i was going to turn 10 years old we were going to cut the cake. But then he said something really funny I even remember when I almost peed myself while laughing. The 3th reason why my father is really funny is because when I'm mad or sad he still makes me happy. This are all the reasons why my father is really funny. The 3th reason why my father means the world to me is because his supportive. When he said \"esta bien mija no llores\". When I was facing a problem he is always there to support me even thought his my step dad his like a real dad to me. He is very supportive when i first joined karate class | loved it and he loved how happy I am. This are all my reasons why my dad is supportive.",
