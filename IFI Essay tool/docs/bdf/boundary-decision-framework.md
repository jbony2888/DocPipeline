Decision Boundary Framework (DBF)

Canonical Specification — v1.0

Status: Public Draft
Author: Jerry Bony
Maintained by: Techluminate Academy
Scope: AI-assisted decision systems in production environments

⸻

1. Purpose

The Decision Boundary Framework defines how AI-assisted systems must separate prediction from authority in order to be trusted, audited, and operated safely in real organizations.

This framework exists because:
	•	AI systems increasingly produce output
	•	Organizations are accountable for decisions
	•	Output without governance creates legal, financial, and operational risk

The DBF formalizes where AI may inform decisions and where systems must enforce them.

⸻

2. Core Definitions (Normative)

2.1 Prediction

A probabilistic signal generated by a model based on historical patterns.

Predictions:
	•	May be incorrect
	•	May be incomplete
	•	Carry uncertainty
	•	Do not constitute truth

2.2 Decision

A deterministic action taken by a system that has real-world consequences.

Decisions:
	•	Must be explainable
	•	Must be enforceable
	•	Must be auditable
	•	Must not originate inside a model

2.3 Decision Boundary

The explicit architectural point at which authority shifts from probabilistic output to deterministic action.

A system without an explicit decision boundary is considered unsafe under this framework.

⸻

3. Foundational Principles (Normative)

All compliant systems MUST adhere to the following principles.

Principle 1 — AI Produces Signals, Not Decisions

AI models MAY generate predictions, classifications, or scores.
They MUST NOT directly trigger irreversible actions.

Principle 2 — Code Enforces Authority

All decisions MUST be enforced through deterministic logic outside the model.

Principle 3 — Verification Precedes Action

Systems MUST verify AI signals against explicit rules before acting.

Principle 4 — Ownership Is Explicit

Every decision MUST have a clearly identifiable owner (human or system role).

Principle 5 — Failure Is Anticipated

Systems MUST define safe behavior under uncertainty, error, or dependency failure.

4. Canonical System Architecture

A Decision Boundary–compliant system follows this structure:

4.1 Ingest Layer
	•	Accepts inputs from users, systems, or events
	•	Performs no interpretation or decision-making

4.2 Signal Layer (AI)
	•	Produces predictions or classifications
	•	Outputs MUST include confidence or uncertainty indicators
	•	Outputs MUST be treated as non-authoritative

4.3 Normalization Layer
	•	Structures data into consistent schemas
	•	Removes ambiguity and noise
	•	Prepares signals for verification

4.4 Verification Layer (Boundary)
	•	Applies thresholds, rules, constraints
	•	Rejects or defers untrusted signals
	•	No model calls permitted in this layer

4.5 Decision Layer
	•	Executes deterministic actions
	•	Routes outcomes
	•	Triggers downstream effects

4.6 Audit Layer
	•	Logs signals, rules, decisions, and outcomes
	•	Enables replay and inspection

⸻

5. Mandatory System Invariants

A system claiming DBF compliance MUST satisfy all invariants below.

5.1 No Unverified Action

No action may be taken without passing verification.

5.2 Determinism

Identical inputs MUST yield identical decisions.

5.3 Idempotency

Duplicate events MUST NOT produce duplicate side effects.

5.4 Explainability

Every decision MUST be traceable to:
	•	Input
	•	Signal
	•	Rule
	•	Outcome

5.5 Safe Degradation

When confidence is insufficient, the system MUST defer, escalate, or refuse to decide.

⸻

6. Anti-Patterns (Non-Compliant)

The following patterns are explicitly non-compliant:
	•	Business logic embedded in prompts
	•	“The model decided…” explanations
	•	Post-hoc natural-language justifications without logs
	•	Decisions inferred from confidence without thresholds
	•	Silent failure or undefined behavior

Any system exhibiting these patterns MUST be considered unsafe.

⸻

7. Evaluation & Certification Alignment

DBF compliance is evaluated through:
	1.	Boundary integrity checks
	2.	Determinism tests
	3.	Failure injection scenarios
	4.	Audit trace inspection
	5.	Operational KPI validation

Operational success WITHOUT technical compliance is insufficient.

⸻

8. Intended Scope

This framework applies to:
	•	SaaS platforms
	•	Internal tooling
	•	Public-facing AI systems
	•	Regulated environments
	•	Nonprofits and government-adjacent systems

It is model-agnostic, vendor-neutral, and stack-independent.

⸻

9. Versioning & Governance

This document:
	•	Is versioned
	•	Is subject to public revision
	•	Evolves through real-world application and feedback

Changes MUST preserve:
	•	Separation of prediction and decision
	•	Explicit authority boundaries
	•	Auditability guarantees

⸻

10. Final Statement

The Decision Boundary Framework is not about building smarter AI.

It is about building systems that can be trusted under pressure.

As AI output scales, decision ownership becomes the scarce resource.

This framework exists to make that ownership explicit.

⸻

Canonical Summary Sentence (You can quote this)

The Decision Boundary Framework defines where AI may inform decisions and where systems must enforce them—so output can scale without sacrificing accountability.

⸻

What You Have Now

With this document, you officially have:
	•	A governance spec
	•	A reference standard
	•	A certification backbone
	•	A language organizations can adopt
	•	A foundation that can outlive tools, models, and trends
