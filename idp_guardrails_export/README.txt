IDP Guardrails Core Export
----------------------------------------

This folder contains a standalone copy of the validation +
attribution + drift guardrails engine extracted from the IFI project.

This file is designed to be copied into another project.

No IFI-specific imports should exist inside idp_guardrails_core.py.
If they do, do not fix them in this step — just report them.
